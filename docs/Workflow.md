# End-to-End Workflow  

## Overview
This document outlines the team formation process, role assignment, project milestones, workflow, and client interactions for the SE Project course. It is designed for reproducibility across terms and as a reference for peer institutions aiming to adopt similar experiential learning models.


---

## 1. Team Formation

- At the beginning of the course, a **Google Form** is circulated to students via official email for self-organized team formation.
- Each team consists of **7–8 members**.
- Students who do not self-organize into a group are **assigned teams** by the course instructors and TAs to ensure inclusivity and even distribution.


---

## 2. Role Distribution

A second Google Form is sent to all teams for selecting individual roles. The following roles are defined:

| Role                     | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Architect / Manager | Oversees the entire project timeline, aligns team goals, ensures timely submissions. |
| Scrum Master             | Facilitates Agile processes, organizes stand-ups, monitors sprint goals.        |
| Frontend Developer       | Designs and implements user interfaces and client-side logic.                  |
| Backend Developer        | Builds and maintains APIs, server-side logic, and database interactions.       |
| Tester                   | Designs and executes test cases, ensures code quality and feature validation.  |


---

## 3. Agile Workflow

Teams follow a lightweight Agile methodology, focusing on:
- Weekly Sprints
- Daily or Bi-weekly Stand-ups
- Sprint Review & Planning
- Maintaining a Trello board / Jira workspace / any project management tool
- Regular updates on Gantt charts and project tracking tool

Milestones guide the Agile iterations.

## 4. Milestones

The project is broken down into six progressive milestones:

| Milestone    | Focus Area                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Milestone 1  | User Requirements                  |
| Milestone 2  | UI Design & Wireframes             |
| Milestone 3  | Scheduling, Design & Prototypes    |
| Milestone 4  | API Development & Integration      |
| Milestone 5  | Test Suite & Evaluation            |
| Milestone 6  | Final Submission & Presentation    |

Each milestone includes a checklist of evaluation parameters for students and TAs in the client meeting.

---

## 5. Weekly Client Meetings

### Purpose
These meetings follow real-world client interaction scenarios, allowing teams to:
- Present progress
- Get feedback on deliverables
- Align with client expectations (taken by TAs/instructors)

### Scheduling
- Teams must reserve a convenient slot for their weekly check-in.

### Guidelines
- No technical help is provided during client meetings.
- These are evaluative and advisory in nature to simulate stakeholder management.
- Technical discussions are held during separate weekly sessions with TAs and professors.

### Attendance Policy
- Mandatory for all team members
- Attendance is monitored and factored into grading and peer evaluations

## Suggested Use

- For Students: Understand expectations and prepare proactively.
- For Instructors: Standardize evaluation and mentoring.
- For Peer Institutions: Replicate or adapt this model for team-based software courses.
