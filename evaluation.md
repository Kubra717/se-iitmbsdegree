# Software Engineering Project Evaluation  

The project is evaluated based on multiple parameters and through various evaluation methods.  

## 1. Instructor Evaluation  
Each milestone is assessed based on unique parameters after submission of milestones by the instructors and course team. The evaluation focuses on:  
- Project quality  
- Functionality and correctness  

---

## 2. Peer Evaluation  
Peer evaluation is a crucial part of the assessment process. Each team member is assigned to evaluate projects from other teams based on specific parameters for each milestone. These parameters are defined by the course team.  

The primary objective of peer evaluation is to expose students to different projects, allowing them to learn from others' work and gain motivation.

## 3. Client Evaluation  
Teaching Assistants (TAs) act as clients and meet each team to assess their progress. Since this may be the studentsâ€™ first software engineering team project, TAs ensure that:  
- Teams are following the correct development process  
- Teams are on track with their milestones  

Additionally, TAs evaluate team involvement and project quality.

## 4. Final Presentation  
After all six milestones are completed and submitted, students present their final project to the professor and course team. This evaluation focuses on:  
- Project functionality  
- Overall project quality based on defined parameters  

This multi-faceted evaluation process ensures a comprehensive assessment of both technical and collaborative aspects of the project.
