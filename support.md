# Communication & Query Resolution

Staying connected and getting help at the right time is key to successfully completing this project. Multiple communication channels are available to support you throughout the course:

---

## 1. GSpace (Google Space) – Team Communication Hub

All students will be added to a dedicated GSpace group that includes:

- Your team members  
- TAs  
- Instructors  

You can use this space for:

- Sharing updates  
- Asking questions  
- Collaborating on documents  
- Clarifying project expectations  

---

## 2. Discourse Forum
**Link:** Link to discourse  

A public forum for posting technical doubts, project-related queries, and checking resolved discussions.

- Use tags relevant to your course or project.  
- Try to search before posting, as many queries may already be answered.  
- Follow basic netiquette and be concise in your questions.

---

## 3. Client Communication

Your client (project mentor or coordinator) is available for clarifying specific expectations, feedback, and feature discussions. You can reach out to them via:

- **Client Meetings:** Scheduled check-ins or Q&A slots.  
- **GSpace Messages:** Tag your client with `@` to raise questions.  
- **Google Chat (GChat):** For quick follow-ups or clarifications outside scheduled meetings.  

Make sure to document important takeaways from client conversations and update your team accordingly.

## 4. Live Sessions

Live sessions often include:

- Q&A time with instructors or TAs  
- Project milestone clarifications  
- Peer interaction and brainstorming  

Keep an eye on the course calendar for session timings.
