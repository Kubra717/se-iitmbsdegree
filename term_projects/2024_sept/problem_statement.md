# Tracking Student Progress in Software Projects

In course projects such as the ones you have already done in **Application Development I and II**, it can be challenging for instructors to effectively track the progress of student projects, particularly in larger classes where multiple teams are working on different tasks.  

To address this issue, you are required to develop a **web application** that allows instructors to manage and monitor student projects throughout the semester. The system should enable the instructor to break down projects into well-defined **milestones**, allowing for clearer tracking of progress and deadlines.  

## Key Features  

- **Integration with GitHub or similar version control systems**  
  - Automatically pull and visualize commit histories  
  - Ensure students are on track with their coding progress  

- **Leveraging Generative AI (GenAI)**  
  - Analyze student-submitted documents such as project proposals, progress reports, and technical documentation  

- **Additional Features to Consider:**  
  - A **centralized dashboard** for instructors to view an overview of all students or teams  
  - **Customizable milestones and task management**  
  - AI-based prediction to determine if students are on track with their projects
