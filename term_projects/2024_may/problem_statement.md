# Effective Integration of Generative AI into Programming Learning Environments

The **SEEK portal** is the primary learning platform for students in the **IITM BS degree program**. The portal contains:
- **Learning videos**
- **Assignments & resources**
- **Practice & graded assignments**
- **Programming quizzes**

The portal can be described as a learning environment and provides opportunities for self-learning, by enabling learners to learn at their own pace and schedule.

With the rapid advancement of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, there are promising possibilities of effective integration of GenAI into these learning environments. The goal of this term's software engineering project is to examine ways in which GenAI can be effectively integrated into learning environments such as SEEK. There are various ways in which possible integrations can be done. Here are some examples -


## **Possible Integrations**
Here are some **potential ways to integrate GenAI** into the SEEK portal:

### **1. Providing Effective Feedback in Programming Tests**
- Currently, test results only indicate **which test cases passed or failed**.
- Can **GenAI generate detailed feedback** on **why** a test case failed and **suggest improvements**?

### **2. AI Assistance for Solving Programming Problems**
- Can **GenAI assist students while they solve coding problems** by:
  - Offering **code suggestions**?
  - Explaining **concepts related to the problem**?
  - Detecting **common mistakes** and providing hints?

### **3. Enhancing Engagement with Learning Content**
- Can **GenAI make static content interactive**?
  - Summarizing PDFs/documents dynamically.
  - Providing **AI-driven Q&A for videos and lecture notes**.
  - Converting textual content into **interactive chatbots**.

The above ideas are just examplesâ€”you're encouraged to explore **new and innovative features**.

## **Project Constraints**
A **full-fledged SEEK clone** is **not feasible** within the project timeline. Instead, you will:
- **Develop a GenAI-enhanced SEEK clone for a single course**.
- **Pre-populate** the system with **learning materials, assignments, quizzes, and resources**.

## **Technology Stack & Tools**
You are encouraged to **leverage existing tools** for efficiency:
- **Code Editor**: Use **ACE Editor** for an embedded programming interface.
- **Online Compiler API**: Use APIs to **compile and run code online**.
- **GenAI Model APIs**: 
  - Use **open-source LLMs** like [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for AI-driven features.
  - Explore **free/open-source AI libraries** for chatbot interactions, auto-feedback, etc.
